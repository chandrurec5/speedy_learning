\section{Problem Setup}
We consider Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithms. An LSA algorithm with design $\D=\langle g,H\rangle$ in $n$ variables is the following stochastic recursion:
\begin{align}\label{linearrec}
x_{t+1}=x_t+\alpha_t(g-H_t x_t)+\alpha_t N_{t+1}.
\end{align}
The assumptions on the variables in \eqref{linearrec} are as under
\begin{assumption}\label{lsaassump}
\hspace{10pt}\\
\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item $x_t\in \R^n$ are the iterates and $\alpha_t\geq 0 ,\forall t\geq 0$ are the step-sizes.
\item\label{pd} $H_t\in \R^{n\times n}$ are i.i.d matrices with $\E[H_t]=H$, where $H$ is a real positive definite design matrix.
\item $g\in \R^n$ is the design vector.
\item $N_{t+1}$ are martingale difference term such that $\E[\parallel N_{t+1} \parallel^2]\leq \sigma^2$ for some variance $\sigma\in \R^+$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}
Using results of theory of SA algorithms if follows that the iterates of \eqref{linearrec} converge i.e., $x_n\ra x^*=H^{-1}g$. In this paper, we like to understand the finite time performance of the LSA algorithms by deriving bounds $\E[\parallel x_n-x^*\parallel^2]$. The bound involves two terms namely the \emph{bias} term due to the initial condition $x_0$ and the variance term due to the noise term. In what follows we make use of the notation $g_{\D}$ and $H_{\D}$ respectivelyy to denote the design vector and matrix of LSA algorithm with design $\D$.
