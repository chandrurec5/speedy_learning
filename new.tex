\section{A new stable TD algorithm}
We now modify the predictor corrector algorithm as follows
\begin{align}
x^m_{t}&=x_t+\beta(g-Hx_t)\\
x_{t+1}&=x_t+\alpha_t(g-Hx^m_t)
\end{align} 
The above recursion can then be written as
\begin{align}
x_{t+1}= (I-\alpha_t (H+\beta H^2))x_t+\alpha_t(g-\beta H g)
\end{align}
Notice that the matrix $H+\beta H^2$ can always be made have all real values positive.
